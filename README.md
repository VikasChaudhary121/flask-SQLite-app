Flask application that interacts with a SQLite database. 
This example will involve CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a simple list of books. 
We'll use SQLAlchemy as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to interact with the SQLite database.

This application allows you to view a list of books, add new books, and delete books.
